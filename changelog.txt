2.3:	February 27, 2009
	- Performance improvements for 3D FFT (realForwardFull() and realInverseFull() for not power-of-two sizes).

	- Refactoring in ConcurrencyUtils.
	- Cosmetic changes.	 

2.1:	December 12, 2008

	- Fixed bug causing ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException when 1D FFT transforms were run  in the following order:
	  realFrowardFull(); complexInverse(); realForwardFull().
	- Added javadoc distribution.
	- Bzip2 is used to compress tar archives.

1.6:	July 15, 2008
